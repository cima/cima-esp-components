# cima-esp-components

A set of components to be used by multiple ESP projects withou duplicating them into those projects. 
This repo is to be cloned independently side by side with those projects and they'll share them.
It is intended to be usable with ESP23 as well as ESP8266 - well see how acheivable it is.
